# Friday Night Funkin' - OS Engine - Modded Psych Engine

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/AndreiRudenko/linc_luajit ` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml

## Mod Support
* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!
* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu.
